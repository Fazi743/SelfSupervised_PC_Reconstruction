# PointCloud-Reconstruction-SelfSupervised

This repository implements a self-supervised learning approach for reconstructing 3D point clouds. It is designed for researchers and developers working on 3D model reconstruction, utilizing self-supervised learning to achieve improved accuracy and structural fidelity in reconstructed point clouds.

## Features
- Self-supervised training approach for point cloud reconstruction
- Python and deep learning libraries used for model development
- Applicable to various 3D data formats and adaptable to other 3D reconstruction tasks

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PointCloud-Reconstruction-SelfSupervised.git
cd PointCloud-Reconstruction-SelfSupervised
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
Prepare your point cloud data in a supported format.
Configure the parameters in config.py or set them in the main script.
Run the training script: python train.py

Evaluate the model on test data: python evaluate.py

Model Architecture
The model employs a self-supervised autoencoder for learning features from point cloud data without requiring labeled samples. Key components include:

Encoder: Extracts features from raw point cloud data.
Decoder: Reconstructs point clouds from the learned latent representations.
Dataset
Ensure you have a dataset of point clouds in the required format. You may use datasets like ShapeNet, ModelNet, or your own custom data.

Results
Detailed results will be displayed upon training completion. For more detailed analysis, you can visualize the reconstructed point clouds using our provided visualization tools.
